# Behavioral Cloning

A Keras based deep CNN that learns how to drive a car based on camera and steering angle data in a simulation environment. After training the model on an AWS EC2 instance using training and validation datasets, the model can drive a car autonomously in a similar or completely different environment in simulation while making sure that the car never leaves the track.
